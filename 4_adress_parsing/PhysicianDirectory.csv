"Agabawi, Salem Ahmad (RL)",Resident - Adult Infectious Disease,Winnipeg,MB,,,,"(RL)  Practitioners with a residency licence are fully registered and enrolled in a resident training program at the University of Manitoba.  By agreement and in return for a reduced annual fee, their licence limits their practice to those duties directly related to the residency program.  They therefore should be regarded as fully qualified medical practitioners but only within the residency program.  Prescriptions issued to patients in the teaching program may be honoured at any pharmacy, but any other prescriptions would be a breach of the licence."

By agreement and in return for a reduced annual fee, their licence limits their practice to those duties directly related to the residency program.  They therefore should be regarded as fully qualified medical practitioners but only within the residency program.  Prescriptions issued to patients in the teaching program may be honoured at any pharmacy, but any other prescriptions would be a breach of the licence."

"Menard, Chantalle Elizabeth (RL)",Resident - Hematology,Winnipeg,MB,,,Internal Medicine,"(RL)  Practitioners with a residency licence are fully registered and enrolled in a resident training program at the University of Manitoba.  By agreement and in return for a reduced annual fee, their licence limits their practice to those duties directly related to the residency program.  They therefore should be regarded as fully qualified medical practitioners but only within the residency program.  Prescriptions issued to patients in the teaching program may be honoured at any pharmacy, but any other prescriptions would be a breach of the licence."

Prescriptions issued to patients in the teaching program may be honoured at any pharmacy, but any other prescriptions would be a breach of the licence."
